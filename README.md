# PiDrivatron

Autonomous RC Car powered by a Raspberry Pi And Machine Learning!

# Goals To Achieve

- A RC Car which can be controlled over the network or via a locally connected gamepad.
- Ability to automatically maneuver along a restricted area. (Control it's direction, and, if possible, speed)
- Stream the camera feed over the network. 
- Have a web control interface. 

# Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (3 Preferred)
- Raspberry Pi Camera (I chose one of the chinese 5MP modules;it shouldn't matter much because we are gonna use a downscaled monochrome image for training)
- Motors and Tires (4 Motors and 4 Tires; Totally your choice)
- Motor Drivers (2x L293D IC's should suffice for our task.)
- 5V Power Supply for Raspberry Pi (Possibly, a Good Powerbank)
- 5V(or more) Power Supply For Motors (Possibly, 18650 Li-Ion Cells/Li-Po battery packs boosted to 5v(or more))

Parts can be easily sourced from AliExpress (or equivalents) or local sites. If you can wait for AliExpress deliveries, then it's totally worth it!
